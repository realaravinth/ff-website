      <h1>ForgeFlux</h1>
      <p>
        ForgeFlux is an attempt at implementing
        <a href="https://forgefed.peers.community">ForgeFed</a>
        external to
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forge_(software)">
          software forges</a
        >
        to provide a decentralised development environment. If successful, major
        software development workflows like pull requests/patches and bug
        trackers will be available in a decentralised context.
      </p>
      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p>
        Free software developers are asked to choose between freedom and having
        access to a large community while choosing a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forge_(software)"
          >software forge</a
        >. Some are willing to make compromises to their freedom in the hopes of
        developing a community around their project while others don't. Either
        way, these are compromises.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, participating in Free Software projects require creating
        and configuring accounts on the forge instances that the projects use.
        Maintaining multiple accounts is a time-consuming process.
      </p>
      <p>
        A mechanism to enable developers on independently run forge instances to
        interact with other forge instances using a single account would solve
        the issues that mentioned above.
        <a href="https://forgefed.peers.community/">ForgeFed</a> is an attempt
        to do just that. But implementing native support for ForgeFed will
        require changes to the forge's source code, which we find to be a
        time-consuming process.
      </p>
      <p>
        ForgeFlux will implement ForgeFed external to the forges, using the
        forge's HTTP APIs. Officially, external federation for Gitea, SourceHut,
        GitLab and GitHub will be implemented but the project will also provide
        tools and guidelines to implement federation for unsupported forges.
      </p>
      <h2>How?</h2>
      <p>
        ForgeFlux will act as an adaptor that will enable federation on forge
        instances by running alongside the forge instances. The deployment
        architecture is very similar to how a third-party integration like
        <a href="https://woodpecker-ci.org/">Woodpecker CI</a> works with
        <a href="https://gitea.io">Gitea</a> &#8212; deploy ForgeFlux next to a
        forge instance and configure authentication to enable federation on the
        forge instance.
      </p>
      <p>
        ForgeFlux software is made-up of multiple components, each of which
        makes up for the lack of native federation features in supported forges:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>Interface: Federation Adaptor</h3>
          <p>
            Interface uses data received from Forge APIs to provide an interface
            that supports ForgeFed. It includes tools and mechanisms to
            implement support for forges that are not Officially supported by
            ForgeFlux.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Northstar: Forge-Interface Discovery service</h3>
          <p>
            ForgeFlux allows for multiple interfaces to be run against a single
            software forge. Also, the protocol is flexible enough to support
            multiple types of software forges(GitLab, GitHub, etc). The
            protocol's decentralised nature makes it impossible to create a
            reliable record of which interfaces service which forges.
          </p>
          <p>
            So we created a discovery service which stores records of interfaces
            and the forges they service. This is very similar to the way DNS
            works. In DNS, hostname is resolved to IP address. Here, software
            forge URL is resolved to URLs of interfaces that service the queried
            forge.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Starchart: Federated Repository Explorer</h3>
          <p>
            Forges provide means for exploring projects that are hosted on the
            forge instance. The federated forge ecosystem needs something
            similar. Starchart solves this problem by crawling the federated
            forge ecosystem(the forge admins will have to authorize crawling)
            and publishing the data for for indexing by search engines and also
            by providing a centralized service to people to explore projects on
            the federated ecosystem.
